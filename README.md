## Usage

To access the help menu, use the `-h` option. Currently, there are two available options:

- `-c`: This option allows you to count HTML tags in a file.
- `-e`: This option launches the editor mode, which enables you to make changes to the file.

The editor mode requires some explanation. After making your desired changes, you can save them by pressing `CTRL+R`. If you decide to discard the changes, you can use `CTRL+O`. It's recommended to use these key combinations to exit the editor mode; otherwise, you will end up with an additional temporary HTML file.

Additionally, please note that in the editor mode, you should use `CTRL+N` to create new lines instead of the Enter key. This ensures proper formatting of the HTML file.
